        <br/>
        <p>Tufts Animal Aid is a student-run organization at Tufts University 
        that pairs volunteer undergraduate students with dogs in the nearby 
        Medford/Somerville area. Our mission is to assist the residents of the 
        Medford/Somerville community while providing stress relief and joy to 
        Tufts students.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>Volunteers commit to walking their dog once a week for a semester 
        (September through December, and February through May). We encourage 
        interested Tufts students and Medford/Somerville dog owners to reach 
        out to us for more information!</p>
